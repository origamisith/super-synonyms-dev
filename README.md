Luke Sedillo's Submission to Computing For All's Challenge: Super Synonyms.
1) The URL to my GitHub-Pages site is https://origamisith.github.io/super-synonyms/
2) I used "WordsAPI because I knew I could use it well to make a simple yet useful project.
3) My API may be used if a word rhymes with another word, the pronunciation of a word, the syllables of a word, and most of the normal things one may find in a dictionary.
4) I used Bootstrap which incorporates FlexBox. FlexBox is very good for responsiveness because it will scale and
take care of rearranging your components for you. I also used Bootstrap's size tags in my column components
   so that I could specify at what screen sizes the buttons should move at. I also used `em` rather than pixels
   so that I could work with device-dependent units of measure rather than absolute pixels.
5) I could make my app accessible to people with blindness or colorblindess by making sure that it is compatible
with the Operating Systems' built-in accessibility features such as screen-reading. I could also have a high 
   color-contrast mode which would make the different colors in my app stand out more.
6) I would tinker with the CSS and Bootstrap a bit more. I am not sure how exactly to get it how I want it,  but
I think I did a decent job for a short amount of time.
